# Protractor Test for Testers

There are number of goals to achieve here:

- Successfully execute the tests
- Add a method that is automatically executed at the end of each 'describe' block to take a screenshot.
    - These screenshots should be saved to disk
    - These screenshots should NOT be committed to git
    - These screenshots should be organised by test run
- Extend the test to:
    - Add a further 4 items to the to do list
    - Remove all of these to do items
    - Test that when the to do list is empty, no items can be removed
- Enable the Protractor Control Flow

Follow any appropriate design patterns.
